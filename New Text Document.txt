git init to initiate a local repo
git status for check wheather any modified files present
git commit -m "message here" #commit and message
gii log #to know the logs
git checkout <git id> #to see the committed version, u can go back using checkout , also check out the HEAD
 do not commit all files only commit what is modified 

git beanch <name of branch>  #crates a new branch
 git branch # will list all the branches present and shows the current branch working on
 git checkout <branch name> # will change the current branch working on
 
 Fast Forward Merge
 gti merge <name of branch(feature)> # this will merge the current branch(master) with the "name of branch(feature)" branch now both head,master,feature is on the last commit
 in this merge master branch was idle feature branch was developed
 git stash #to revert to the last commit


Recursive Branh
 when two branches developed with on different files(!important)
for this merge a new commit is opened on the current branch(master) and the files were merged
the feature branch will be left at the old position
if the same file is modified in differnet branch confilt will occur

 git log --all --decorate --graph # to see the graph
 


 Conflict Case
 git will show an error and suggest to fix it and then commit 
 then when u open the file u can see the both code then manually select the code which you want or both then commit
  

  git remote add <name of the remote (origin)> <remote repo url> #to add the remote repo
  git remote -v # to see the all remote repos
  git push <name of the remote (origin)> <branch name (master)> #push the code into remote repo
